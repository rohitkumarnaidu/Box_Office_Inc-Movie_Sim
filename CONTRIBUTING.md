# Coding Standards

## JavaScript

- Use modern ES6+ syntax.
- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configuration.

## React

- Use functional components.
- Prefer React Hooks.
- Keep components modular and reusable.
- Use Redux Toolkit `createSlice` for state management.
- Place API calls in custom hooks or service modules, not in components.

## Naming Conventions

- Variables → `camelCase`
- Functions → `camelCase`
- React Components → `PascalCase`
- Constants → `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- File names match exported component names (e.g., `ActorCard.jsx` exports `ActorCard`).
- Slice files are named with camelCase (`authSlice.js`, `movieSlice.js`).

## Styling

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes. Avoid inline styles for layout.
- Use CSS variables (via `ThemeContext`) for theme-aware colors.
- Follow existing spacing patterns (p-4, p-6, gap-4, rounded-2xl, etc.).
- Responsive design: test on mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px).

## Testing

- Backend: Node.js built-in test runner, files in `backend/tests/`.
- Run `npm test` in the `backend/` directory.
- Frontend tests should be added in `frontend/src/__tests__/` using Vitest.

## Comments

Write comments only where necessary to explain complex logic. Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.
