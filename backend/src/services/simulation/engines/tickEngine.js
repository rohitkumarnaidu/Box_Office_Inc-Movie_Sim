/**
 * @fileoverview Tick Engine — Weekly Simulation Orchestrator
 *
 * This is the central coordinator for a single simulation week. It calls every
 * sub-engine in a specific, intentional order so that each phase can observe
 * the side-effects of the previous phase.
 *
 * ## Execution Order (per weekly tick)
 * 1. **Market Trends** — advance the genre trend climate; any trend notifications
 *    are queued before other events so they appear at the top of the feed.
 * 2. **Writer Payroll** — deduct all talent salaries from studio funds while
 *    the market state is already up-to-date.
 * 3. **Writing Projects** — advance writer projects; may complete scripts and
 *    free writers back to the market.
 * 4. **Directing Projects** — advance director projects; may complete pre-production
 *    packages and free directors.
 * 5. **Production** — advance movies through PRE_PRODUCTION → PRODUCTION →
 *    POST_PRODUCTION → READY_FOR_RELEASE.
 * 6. **Writer Aging** — age all writers by one week-unit (runs yearly).
 * 7. **Director Aging** — age all directors; retire those past the age cap.
 * 8. **Director Awards** — evaluate award eligibility for owned directors.
 * 9. **Random Events** — roll for industry events last so they react to the
 *    week's financial activity and can adjust studio stats before persistence.
 *
 * @module tickEngine

/**
 * Runs one full week of the simulation for a studio.

 * Mutates `gameState` and `studio` in place across all sub-engines. The caller
 * (`runWeeklySimulation`) is responsible for persisting both documents after
 * this function resolves.
 *
 * Market talent (directors, actors) is now stored in separate collections to
 * avoid unbounded GameState document growth (issue #188). Award processing
 * temporarily attaches market directors/actors to the gameState object for
 * backward compatibility with the awards services.
