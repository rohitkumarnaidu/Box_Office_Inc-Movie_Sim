/**
 * @fileoverview Production Engine
 *
 * Manages the progression of active movies through three sequential
 * production stages: PRE_PRODUCTION → PRODUCTION → POST_PRODUCTION →
 * READY_FOR_RELEASE.
 *
 * Each week (tick), every active movie advances by one week within its
 * current stage. Talent reliability can cause delays (stall progress) or
 * accelerate production (bonus progress week). When a stage completes, the
 * movie transitions to the next stage and any attached talent is freed upon
 * reaching READY_FOR_RELEASE.
 *
 * ## Stage Durations
 * | Stage           | Weeks |
 * |-----------------|-------|
 * | PRE_PRODUCTION  |   4   |
 * | PRODUCTION      |  10   |
 * | POST_PRODUCTION |   6   |
 * | **Total**       | **20**|
 *
 * Movies are persisted (`movie.save()`) after every update.

/**
 * Advances all active movies through their production stages for one week.
 *
 * ## Reliability System
 * Average reliability is computed across the attached director, lead actor,
 * and crew team. Missing talent defaults to 50 (neutral).
 *
 * | Condition                         | Effect                         |
 * |-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
 * | avgReliability < 40 AND roll < 20 | Delay: no progress this week   |
 * | avgReliability > 80 AND roll > 80 | Bonus: +2 weeks progress       |
 * | Otherwise                         | Normal: +1 week progress       |
 *
 * ## Progress Calculation
 * `productionProgress` is a 0–100 percentage of the full 20-week pipeline.
 * `remainingWeeks` counts weeks left until READY_FOR_RELEASE.
 *
 * When a movie reaches READY_FOR_RELEASE:
 * - `productionProgress` is set to 100.
 * - `releaseWeek` is set to `currentWeek + 1` (suggested release window).
 * - All attached talent is freed (status → "AVAILABLE", busyUntilWeek → null).
 *
