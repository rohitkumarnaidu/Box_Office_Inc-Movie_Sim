/**
 * @fileoverview Director Aging Engine
 *
 * Handles annual aging and retirement of directors in both the owned roster and
 * the public market pool. Runs once per simulated year (every 52 weeks) to keep
 * the director economy realistic.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle (Market Directors — stored in separate MarketDirector collection)
 * 1. Fetch all market directors for this game from the MarketDirector collection.
 * 2. Age increments by +1 for every non-retired director.
 * 3. Directors reaching `RETIREMENT_AGE` (90) are retired:
 *    - Removed from the MarketDirector collection.
 *    - Archived into `gameState.retiredDirectors`.
 * 4. For every director that retires, one fresh replacement director is generated
 *    and inserted into the MarketDirector collection — keeping total market supply stable.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle (Owned Directors — still embedded in GameState)
 * 1. Same aging/retirement logic applied to `gameState.ownedDirectors`.
 * 2. Retired owned directors have their active projects flagged for replacement.
 * 3. Retired owned directors are moved to `gameState.retiredDirectors`.
 * 4. A replacement is added to the market pool (MarketDirector collection).
