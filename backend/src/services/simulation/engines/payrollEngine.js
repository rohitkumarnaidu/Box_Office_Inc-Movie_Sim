/**
 * @fileoverview Payroll Engine
 *
 * Processes weekly payroll for all talent under contract: writers, directors,
 * actors, and crew teams. The total weekly wage bill is deducted from the
 * studio's money balance once per simulation tick.
 *
 * If the studio cannot fully cover payroll, a proportional partial payment
 * is made (payrollCoverage < 1). Individual `totalEarnings` on each talent
 * object are updated to reflect only the amount actually paid, so the ledger
 * stays accurate even during financial hardship.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - Payroll fires every week regardless of project status (bench cost model).
 * - Studio money is floored at 0; it can never go negative from payroll alone.
 * - When the studio balance is already at or below 0 the run is skipped entirely
 *   and a bankruptcy-risk warning is emitted instead, preventing further
 *   deductions from compounding on an already-insolvent studio (#276).
 * - `talent.salary` is treated as a weekly figure.

/**
 * Deducts weekly talent salaries from the studio's money balance.
 *
 * ## Algorithm
 * 1. Aggregate all talent from `ownedWriters`, `ownedDirectors`, `ownedActors`,
 *    and `ownedCrewTeams`.
 * 2. Sum their salaries to get `totalPayroll`.
 * 3. If `studio.money < totalPayroll`, push a notification warning.
 * 4. Compute `payrollCoverage = min(1, availableMoney / totalPayroll)`.
 * 5. Each talent's `totalEarnings` is incremented by their pro-rated salary.
 * 6. Deduct the amount actually paid out (sum of pro-rated salaries) from
 *    studio money (floored at 0).
 *
 * No-ops when there is no talent or total payroll is zero.
 *
